# TMProject

This project is based on a decompilation of the With Your Destiny game client.
We do not claim any copyright to the project. This project was created for study purposes only, all rights reserved exclusively and entirely by Hanbitsoft.

This Code is a complete decompilation of the original client, nothing developers like us would ever do. As the project as a whole has already been completely finished, having all the necessary functions for the game to be playable, it can be changed as you wish.

## compilation
The project can only be compiled for Windows using Visual Studio (the project is prepared for the 2019 version, but there is no limitation on the minimum or maximum version).

Compiling for x64 is possible, just use the dependency for x64 of DirectX as well as correcting problems regarding compilation for this architecture.

## Dependencies

### Visual Studio
To compile the project you will need to have Visual Studio with the following components installed:
- Desktop development with C++
- C++ ATL for the toolchain version being used

The only external dependency of the project is DirectX, however it is included in the repository and properly configured.

## bugs
This project is a decompile and it can and does have problems.

Feel free to report them and open a pull request for the project (we hope you will).

### Pull-request
To keep the code more organized, the current code pattern should be followed, for example:
- Variables with Hungarian style, e.g: pPointer, nInt, bBoolean, sz for sized string and etc.
- Name of classes in PascalCase
- between others...

As we don't have a document that dictates all the rules, if you have a question, look in the code for an example of what you're trying to do.
