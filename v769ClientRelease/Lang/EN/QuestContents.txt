FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Hey there, young lad...
FFFFFF This is our first meeting...? Anything wrong?
FFFFFF Oh... well... so you would like to become a knight...?
FFFFFF Then let me tell you a great place to start. There is
FFFFFF a "Novice Village" to the east of Armia that teaches
FFFFFF beginners lots of tricks and experience to get started,
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF There are many trainers located there to aid you.
FFFFFF Don't forget, each of them possess special powers   
FFFFFF that gives you different kinds of blessings. See you later!
FFFFFF 
AAFFFF Go and look for Armia's Trainer Leader then!

FFFFAA << Spirit Guardian >>
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Lad.. Rumour says that there is an ancient spirit resting
FFFFFF in the graveyard near Armia. But the number of monster 
FFFFFF has recently been on the rise. There was an inpector 
FFFFFF which talks about something shocking: "The Ancient Spirit"
FFFFFF which rests here is about to be summoned by someone  
FFFFFF known as the "Demon Worshipper". We must prevent the 
FFFFFF ancient spirit from falling under the influence of demonic 
FFFFFF curses at all cost! If any of these ancient spirits are 
FFFFFF revived, save them by killing them! So then the rescued 
FFFFFF souls may depart with the wisdom chest that carries
FFFFFF ancient knowledge.

FFFFAA << Conquering Orc Castle >>
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Hey... lad... Have you heard of orcs before? Hehe...
FFFFFF I heard there's still people who have never heard of Orcs
FFFFFF before... These orcs have established a base of operation 
FFFFFF on the abandoned castle between Armia and Azran, and 
FFFFFF prey upon the lives and money of travellers and 
FFFFFF adventurers The leader of the pack, 'Orc Lord', which is 
FFFFFF under the influence of a certain demonic pill, has been 
FFFFFF eyeing the villages for a long time. Many brave 
FFFFFF adventurers who have sought to hunt him met with 
FFFFFF gruesome fate. If you defeat the orc lord, and get the 
FFFFFF 'Carbunkle Heart' from him, you will find great powers 
FFFFFF within it. Well? Would you want to give it a try now?
AAFFFF Defeat the orc guardian in front of each castle gate

FFFFAA << Defending Mystery Land >>
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Lad... Rumor has it that there is a place near Azran village
FFFFFF that produces mysterious gems. We call it the "Mystery
FFFFFF Land". Not too long ago, a group of miners was 
FFFFFF dispatched there to establish a mining  facility, but the 
FFFFFF miners were met with constant attacks from the monsters. 
FFFFFF I heard the knight leader has posted offers to hire 
FFFFFF merceneries to help defend this mysterious place. Would 
FFFFFF you want to give it a try? There will be a hefty reward.

FFFFFF Would you like to help recover these fragments? If you 
FFFFFF can return these fragments to Prophet Kelunok, he will be 
FFFFFF able to fashion the Complete Luck which is a holy object
FFFFFF that carries god's blessing. Then you would be able to

FFFFFF of the Azran village. It was a place the gods used for 
FFFFFF calming the humans during the Great Heavenly War. 
FFFFFF When the war was over, the villagers decorated the
FFFFFF Sacred Garden, retaining god's blessing until today. But 
FFFFFF due to the monster attacks the Sacred Garden slowly

FFFFFF Hehe... This happened long ago. There was this great
FFFFFF hero knight from Armia called 'Kaizen', who was the mortal
FFFFFF that lead the Victorious war in the great Heavenly War.
FFFFFF Soon after Kaizen passed away, he was buried in the
FFFFFF tomb underneath the palace. The monster "Skeletal
FFFFFF Summoner", who had been hiding "in the tomb awakened
FFFFFF Kaizen. Kaizen is now as the ¡°Death Knight Kaizen¡±.  If
FFFFFF they were to raid the village, bloodshed will begin There's

FFFFFF 
FFFFFF I think you have heard about this rumor. It seems to be 
FFFFFF real. Whenever someone uses a Gargoyle¡¯s Tooth on 
FFFFFF their equipment, it would improve the equipment 
FFFFFF dramatically. But acquiring one of these Gargoyle¡¯s Tooth 
FFFFFF is not an easy task. These creatures reside deep in the 
FFFFFF underground dungeon, along with many others just as 
FFFFFF enormous. Many who ventured there have never 
FFFFFF returned. Think carefully before you make a decision to 
FFFFFF go, but think about all the power a Gargoyle¡¯s Tooth could 
FFFFFF bring you. It could be well worth the effort.

FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Young Squire, it is time to take the challenge to become 
FFFFFF one of the kingdom's Knight. However, our nation is 
FFFFFF divided into two. Each holding its own meaning and hopes 
FFFFFF for advancements. It will be hard to choose between the 
FFFFFF 'Hekaloth Kingdom' which bears the name of Heavenly 
FFFFFF Nation or 'Akelonia Kingdom' which carries the meaning of 
FFFFFF divine blessings. The decision to join which kingdom rests 
FFFFFF on the shoulders of the Knight. Once you make that 
FFFFFF decision, you will protect your kingdom with faith and 
FFFFFF devotion. There will be more perilous journeys awaiting 
FFFFFF you. You must keep your word and serve your kingdom
FFFFFF to expand its influence until the day both kingdoms unite.

FFFFFF Hrm... What a tough battle. I'm refering to the battle with 
FFFFFF the bloody Medusa near the Swamp north of Armia. Such 
FFFFFF painful memories. But recently, I heard that the medusa 
FFFFFF left the swamp and fled into the Underground dungeon. 
FFFFFF There, with the use of the Eye of Blood, she found ways 
FFFFFF to evil powers turning her into the Golden Medusa. The 
FFFFFF safety of Armia will be in jeopardy if this continues. Like 
FFFFFF the medussa, if any man can acquire the Eye of Blood, 
FFFFFF their knowledge and powers will be boosted significantly.

FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Civilization was almost destroyed during the Great 
FFFFFF Heavenly War. The few survivors founded Armia and 
FFFFFF started a new life on this piece of land. Over the decades, 
FFFFFF several races of creatures have been attracted into 
FFFFFF plundering the wealth of Armia. These creatures had 
FFFFFF eternal life, much different to the humans. Driven by 
FFFFFF greed and jealousy, the humans pursued the monsters 
FFFFFF into the deep hellgate. The creatures that was thrown
FFFFFF into the hellgate eventually banded together with hatred 
FFFFFF and revenge. These dark hunter is now on the prowl to 
FFFFFF cause more destructions and evil to the worlds.
