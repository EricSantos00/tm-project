FFFFAA << Divine Circle >> 
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF I heard about the ruckus of reconstructing the divine 
FFFFFF circle recently. It was believed that after the destruction 
FFFFFF of the sacred temple, most of the sacred stone has fallen
FFFFFF into the hands of powerful giant demons. If you come 
FFFFFF accross magical fragment, simply hand it to Alchemist Jeffi, 
FFFFFF along with some fees, he will be able to purify them once 
FFFFFF again, and restore it's power. You will be able to use 
FFFFFF these stones to tune your inner powers.
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF If you are interested in tuning your strengths,
FFFFFF go ahead and find it. Good luck.

FFFFAA << Monster Trader >>
FFFFFF 
FFFFFF Monster trader... I remember meeting one before. Haha, 
FFFFFF isn't it funny to see a monster selling items? Although it is 
FFFFFF a monster, does not necessary mean it is evil. Is it not the
FFFFFF the same with human? These creatures runs really fast, 
FFFFFF catching up to them to buy their goods is not an easy 
FFFFFF task. However, if you can halt them, browsing through 
FFFFFF their goods for sale will not be a problem. Everything 
FFFFFF depends on your luck, whether you can meet up with 
FFFFFF them or not.
